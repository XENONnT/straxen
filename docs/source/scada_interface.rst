SCADA Interface
===============
The SCADA Interface is a XENONnT specific tool which allows analysers and other tools to communicate
with our slow control database. The communication is done via different `webservice tools`_ provided
by the slow control team. Slow control data can be only accessed via midway. A little tutorial
notebook about the interface can be found in the subsequent notebook.
